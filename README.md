# React Todo App with API

In this task, I implemented ToDoList. The user is authorized by email. After that, he gets access to his own ToDolist, tasks from which are downloaded from the server. The user also has the ability to add new ToDos, delete, edit and filter existing ones.

> Here is [DEMO LINK](https://github.com/viktoriia-ovcharenko/react_todo-app-with-api/tree/develop#readme)


In the project directory, you can run:

- npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.
