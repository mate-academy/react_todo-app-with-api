## Introduction

Welcome to the **React Todo App with API** â€“ an efficient, user-friendly, and highly functional task management application designed to simplify your daily task tracking.

## Why You'll Love It

### Real-Time Updates
The app interacts with an API to ensure that your data is always up-to-date. When you toggle a todo's status or rename it, the changes are immediately reflected, giving you a smooth and responsive experience.

### Optimized Performance
- **Loader Overlays**: While waiting for API responses, the app displays loader overlays, keeping you informed about the background processes and ensuring that you always know the current state of your actions.
- **Context Management**: All data is stored in the context, making state management efficient and the application performant.

### Comprehensive Todo Management
- **Toggling Todos**: Easily toggle the completion status of individual todos or all todos at once using the `toggleAll` checkbox. The `toggleAll` button activates only if all todos are marked as completed, ensuring precise control over your task list.
- **Renaming Todos**: Edit todo titles with a simple double-click. The intuitive editing form allows you to save changes on submit or when the input field loses focus. It also handles edge cases like empty titles or unchanged titles gracefully.

### Error Handling
- **User Notifications**: In case of any API errors, the app provides clear notifications such as `Unable to update a todo` or deletion error messages, keeping you informed and reducing confusion.

## Key Features

### Toggle Todo Status
- **Individual Toggle**: Toggle the `completed` status of each todo with instant feedback.
- **Bulk Toggle**: Use the `toggleAll` checkbox to change the status of all todos simultaneously. The app ensures that only the todos with actual status changes trigger API requests, optimizing performance.

### Rename Todos
- **Inline Editing**: Double-click a todo title to switch to edit mode. Changes are saved on `Enter` or when the input field loses focus.
- **Smart Handling**: If the new title is the same as the old one, editing is canceled. If the title is empty, the todo is deleted automatically, streamlining your workflow.
- **Error Feedback**: The app shows loaders during API calls and provides error messages if updates fail.
