 I created a powerful todo app using React, with the ability to fetch data from a server and post new requests to the server.The app also includes functionality to filter and sort the todos based on their status, priority, or due date, with the ability to mark todos as complete or delete them from the list.To post new requests to the server, I implemented a form using React components and state, with form validation and error handling.I used React hooks, such as useEffect and useState, to manage the component lifecycle and state changes.
