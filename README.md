# React Todo App with API

I implemented a convenient, animated form for work with user's todos.

You can adding todos, edit the names, statuses of already existing ones, and also delete them from the server. <br />
Each action is accompanied by a request to the server and the return of a certain result.

Technoligis: React.js, FETCH, REST API, AJAX, TypeScript, JavaScript, Boolma, BEM, SCSS, HTML.
