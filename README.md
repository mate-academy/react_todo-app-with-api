# React Todo App with API (complete)

It is the third part of the React Todo App with API.

Take your code implemented for [Add and Delete](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_todo-app-add-and-delete)
and implement the ability to toggle and rename todos.

> Here is [the working example](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_todo-app-with-api/)

## Toggling a todo status

Toggle the `completed` status on `TodoStatus` change:

- covered the todo with a loader overlay while wating for API response;
- the status should be changed on success;
- show the `Unable to update a todo` notification in case of API error.

Add the ability to toggle the completed status of all the todos with the `toggleAll` checkbox:

- `toggleAll` button should have `active` class only if all the todos are completed;
- `toggleAll` click changes its status to the oppsite one, and set it to all the todos;
- it should work the same as several individual updates of the todos which statuses were actually changed;
- do send requests for the todos that were not changed;

## Renaming a todo

Implement the ability to edit a todo title on double click:

- show the edit form instead of the title and remove button;
- saves changes on the form submit (just press `Enter`);
- save changes when the field loses focus (`onBlur`);
- if new title is the same as the old one just cancel editing;
- cancel editing on `Es—Å` key `keyup` event;
- if the new title is empty delete the todo the same way the `x` button does it;
- if the title was changed show the loader while waiting for the API response;
- update the todo title on success;
- show `Unable to update a todo` in case of API error;
- or the deletion error message if we tried to delete the todo.

## Instructions

- Implement a solution following the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline).
- Use the [React TypeScript cheat sheet](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/js/extra/react-typescript).
- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://olecsiy-gavrilyuk.github.io/react_todo-app-with-api/) and add it to the PR description.
